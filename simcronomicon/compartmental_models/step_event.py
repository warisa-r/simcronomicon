        Initialize a StepEvent. A StepEvent is an instance that defines an agents' activities in a day.

        A StepEvent contained a name, an action that is performed by the agent when this StepEvent is being
        carried out, a maximum distance that agents will travel to perform this event, and the place types
        of the event.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            Name of the event.
        folk_action : callable
            Function to execute for each folk during the event. Must accept 4 arguments (folks_here, status_dict_t, model_params, dice).
        event_type : EventType, optional
            Type of the event (default: EventType.SEND_HOME).
        max_distance : int, optional
            Maximum distance in meters for the event (default: 0).
        place_types : list, optional
            List of place types relevant for the event (default: []).
        probability_func : callable, optional
            Function that takes a list of distances and returns a list of probabilities of those distances based on the probability
            function you want to use to model human mobility.
            If None, uniform probability is used.
