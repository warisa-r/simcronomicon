class StepEvent:
    """
    Defines agent activities and movement patterns during simulation timesteps.

    StepEvent objects represent discrete activities that agents perform during
    simulation timesteps. Each event specifies how agents move through the town
    network, what types of locations they visit, and what actions they perform
    when they arrive at destinations.

    Purpose
    -------
    1. **Agent Movement Control**: Define where and how far agents travel during
       specific activities (work, shopping, healthcare visits, etc.).

    2. **Location Targeting**: Specify which types of places agents visit for
       different activities using place type filters.

    3. **Mobility Modeling**: Apply realistic human mobility patterns through
       customizable probability functions based on distance.

    Event Types
    -----------
    - **DISPERSE**: Agents move to locations within specified distance and place
      type constraints. Enables agent-to-agent interactions at destinations.
    - **SEND_HOME**: All agents return directly to their home addresses without
      movement or interaction. Represents end-of-day or emergency scenarios.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Event identifier.
    max_distance : int
        Maximum travel distance in meters.
    place_types : list
        Allowed destination place types.
    event_type : EventType
        Movement behavior type.
    folk_action : callable
        Agent interaction function.
    probability_func : callable or None
        Distance-based mobility probability function.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # End of day event
    >>> end_day = StepEvent("end_day", folk_class.sleep)
    >>> 
    >>> # Work event with specific constraints
    >>> work = StepEvent("work", folk_class.interact, EventType.DISPERSE,
